                    My team and I voted on wanting to solve the <b>food waste problem</b> the world is facing today. Our original idea was to solve this by focusing on restaurant waste and trying to find ways customers could take advantage of excess food at the end of the day. However, from our interviews and customer discovery, along with industry professionals working on this problem, we realized the problem lay in the <b>personal waste space.</b><br></br>

                <p class="description1">Speaking to restaurant owners, we came up with some fundamental truths:<br></br>

                01  Most <b>restaurants cook on demand</b>, leading to no excess waste at the end of the day<br>

                02  If certain restaurants have <b>extra food they often reuse it</b> the next day (this is the case with buffets)<br>

                03  Fresh <b>produce</b> must be thrown out by the <b>end of the day</b> (food safety)<br>

                04  Restaurants already optimize how much theyâ€™re using, based on <b>customer patterns</b> (Saturdays are popular, Thursdays are not)<br>

                05  Some restaurants prefer donation because <b>reselling food would require extra time and effort</b> beyond hours of operation<br>

                06  Safety or the <b>"freshness"</b> of excess food is an issue<br></br>

                In summary, we found that <b>minimizing waste for restaurants may prove difficult.</b></p>

                <p class="description1">From our restaurant interviews, we found that <b>produce is the most wasted type of food</b>, since it goes bad so quickly and cannot be kept due to stringent safety conditions for restaurants.<br></br><br>For this reason, we tried to look at produce waste from a different angle: by <b>looking at grocery stores.</b><br></br></p>

                <p class="description1">We contacted local Pittsburgh grocery store chains, such as Giant Eagle, Aldi, and Trader Joe's and
                asked some guiding questions:<br></br>

                <b>How often do you waste produce?<br>
                How do you know how much shoppers will purchase each week?<br>
                What do you do with excess produce?</b><br></br>

                The responses were overwhelmingly similar across the board. Grocers overstock for the proper look and feel of the store.<br>

                According to Business Insider, the fundamental business model of supermarkets dictates that <b>stores be fully stocked with whatever customers want at any time so they don't run to a competitor.</b> Customers have been <b>trained to expect perfect, identically shaped produce.</b> Retailers stock their produce according to that expectation â€” even if the shape, size, and color have nothing to do with quality.<br>

                Doug Rauch, the former president of Trader Joe's and Julie Saunders, a Pittsburgh consultant currently working with Giant Eagle (she attended our in-class critiques), have verified this phenomenon based on their experience - if you see a store that has really low waste in perishables, as a grocery manager you should be worried. <br><b>If a store has low waste numbers, it can be a sign of an unsatisfactory customer experience.</b><br>

                In short, grocery stores have no choice but to abide by the picky tastes of consumers. Based on some preliminary research, we found that consumers buy too much food, throw it away too quickly, and pay little attention to waste. A lack of education of both consumers and sellers on food safety and food waste has led to bad habits and wasteful selling practices. A huge percentage of food waste could be mitigated if more Americans were willing to buy bananas with brown spots, or if they understood they can eat yogurt two weeks after its sell-by date.<br>

                With evidence in the numbers, we pivoted to focus on grocery shoppers and the shopping experience to identify ways to mitigate the food waste problem.<br>

                <p id="rowoverview2">05 Ideation</p>

                <p class="description1">There are a couple parts to the grocery shopping process. We spoke to different kinds of grocery shoppers and asked questions on what part of the process made it so difficult to reduce waste and what types of services shoppers wished existed to aid them in this process.<br>



                ----Make a graphic with the questions (types of customers: college students, working adults, moms)----

                Along with shopper interviews, we also conducted co-design sessions revolving around an artifact - a plate of spoiled food. The goal was to evoke any sentiments associated with the plate and additionally ask questions about interviewee shopping, storage, and consumption habits. We interviewed around 20 candidates and found that almost 80% of candidates had some issue keeping track of their food.<br>

              we found that consumers buy too much food, throw it away quickly and pay little attention to waste, especially given lack of time - a huge percentage of waste could be mitigated if consumers were willing to buy bananas with brown spots, or if they understood they can eat yogurt two weeks after its sell-by</p>
