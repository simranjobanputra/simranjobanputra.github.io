                <br>
                <p class="description1">Speaking to restaurant owners, we came up with some fundamental truths:<br></br>

                01  Most <b>restaurants cook on demand</b>, leading to no excess waste at the end of the day<br>

                02  If certain restaurants have <b>extra food they often reuse it</b> the next day (this is the case with buffets)<br>

                03  Fresh <b>produce</b> must be thrown out by the <b>end of the day</b> (food safety)<br>

                04  Restaurants already optimize how much they’re using, based on <b>customer patterns</b> (Saturdays are popular, Thursdays are not)<br>

                05  Some restaurants prefer donation because <b>reselling food would require extra time and effort</b> beyond hours of operation<br>

                06  Safety or the <b>"freshness"</b> of excess food is an issue<br></br>

                In summary, we found that <b>minimizing waste for restaurants may prove difficult.</b></p>

                <p id="rowoverview2">04 Pivoting to Personal Waste</p>
                <p class="description1">From our restaurant interviews, we found that <b>produce is the most wasted type of food</b>, since it goes bad so quickly and cannot be kept due to stringent safety conditions for restaurants.For this reason, we tried to look at produce waste from a different angle: by <b>looking at grocery stores.</b> We contacted local grocery stores, such as Giant Eagle, Aldi, and Trader Joe's and <b>asked about wasted produce and shopper habits.</b>

              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p class="description1">The responses were overwhelmingly similar across the board. <b>Grocers overstock for the proper look and feel of the store - and with good reason.</b> According to Business Insider, the fundamental business model of supermarkets dictates that:<br></br>01 <b> Stores be fully stocked so customers don't run to competitors.</b><br>02<b> Customers expect perfect, identically shaped produce.</b><br> 03<b> Thus, retailers must stock according to customer expectations. </b><br>

                <p class="description1">Doug Rauch, the former president of Trader Joe's reaffirms this, stating that <b>if a store has low waste numbers, it can be a sign of an unsatisfactory customer experience.</b> Topping that, consumers lead to 92 billion lbs of waste while retailers lead to less than half at 42 billion lbs. With evidence in the numbers, we pivoted<br>to focus on <b>grocery shoppers and the shopping experience</b> to identify ways to mitigate the food waste problem.</p>

                <p class="description1">Along with shopper interviews, we also conducted <b>co-design sessions</b> revolving around an artifact - a plate of spoiled food. The goal was to <b>evoke any sentiments</b> associated with the plate and additionally ask questions about interviewee shopping, storage, and consumption habits. We interviewed around 20 candidates and found that almost <b>80%</b> of candidates had some issue keeping track of their food.</p>

                <p class="description1">Based on the initial insights, we created a paper prototype of an all encompassing platform - one which tracked expiration dates, gave meal recipes, and also helped plan out grocery shopping by taking account of your vitals (body height, weight, and diet). We took inspiration from several of our current competitors, like Blue Apron and Hello Chef. Most people felt <b>the service was promising, but too all ecompassing/overwhelming</b> as it tried to do too many things at the same time.</p><br>

                <p class="description1">During many of our lectures, we would have in-class critiques from local professionals. From these discussions and our first-hand research, we realized <b>the problem stems from users not understanding expiry dates or when food goes bad.</b> From there, we can tackle a lot of the issues customers face. This is when the idea of <b>Lemon</b>, our new service, was born.</p><br>

                <p class="description1">We decided there were a couple different ways to feed information about grocery purchases into our application: through a picture of the grocery receipt, an in-fridge smart camera, or manual entry. We created storyboards and gauged for reactions. The in-fridge smart camera was a huge privacy concern, while a picture of the receipt was the most well received.</p>
