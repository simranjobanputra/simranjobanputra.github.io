                <p class="description1">This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to be a <b>UX Designer for the SPIFe (Scheduling and Planning System for Exploration) team at the NASA AMES Research Center</b>. The team had a work process similar to that of a startup embedded within a larger organization. I worked on <b>two main projects: NASA HUNCH and Playbook.</b> Over the summer, I grew my technical design knowledge and was able to learn how to work with software developers in an agile development environment. I'm going to take a deep dive into Playbook and summarize my work with NASA HUNCH.</p>

                <p class="description1">Playbook is an intuitive software designed to help astronauts <b>edit certain adjustable activities</b>in space or on other analog missions, <b>without needing to rely on mission control</b> everytime there is a small change. This has a useful application in missions where there is a <b>time lag</b> between mission control (Earth) and the astronauts who may be on the Moon or Mars. Currently, this software is used on analog missions(field tests in locations that have physical similarities to extreme space environments) such as NASA NEEMO, but the hope is our software can be used for Mars 2020 and the like!</p>

                 <p class="description1">At the beginning of this project, I read a lot of research publications to try to understand the basic use case of Playbook. Here is my visual interpretation of Playbook: an iPad application used to create <b>convenience</b> and <b>independence</b> in editing mission activities.</p>

                  <p class="description1">My research began with learning about the <b>use cases of Playbook, the current features, and the way the current interface works.</b> I asked my teammates several questions and asked them to demo particular actions for me as well. My team also gave me access to a tester site so I could play around with features and user flows on my own, which was really crucial in problem discovery.</p>

                <p class="description1">As I was playing around with the tester site, I noticed that it took a <b>considerable number of clicks</b> to commit to a certain action. I noticed this had a lot to do with the design of the Playbook system, specifically having an <b>action tray</b> - a tray that pops out when you need to make edits to the schedule. Before going into my main tasking, I decided to see if we could <b>clean up the user flow</b> of editing something. </p>

                <p class="description1" id="userflow2">The proposed user flow cuts the number of clicks by <b>44%</b>! Although it's only a few clicks change per action, it easily adds up as crewmembers are constantly changing their schedule throughout spaceflight. The key changes were <b>repurposing the activity tray</b> as a space where actions can also occur to activities and not just as an informational space. This eliminated the need for pop-ups and the like. Additionally, <b>cutting the preferences</b> to the bare minimum really helped in saving clicks (for example having an entry rather than click through a long list of numbers).</p>

                  <p id="subheader">Overview</p>
                    <p class="description1">NASA HUNCH is a website that aims to empower and inspire high school students and give them the opportunity to launch their careers through participation in the design and fabrication of real world valued products for NASA. The goal of the site is to be a platform to <b>raise awareness of the International Space Station, current HUNCH projects, and to enable students to showcase their work and connect with NASA social media sites.</b>I was tasked with revamping and creating new webpages for the site. Specifically, I built a <b>new social media page</b>that allowed easy access to NASA HUNCH's social media channels and also built a <b>blog page where schools</b>could showcase the work of their students and be inspired by the work of other educator s across the country. I was able to learn a lot about <b>APIs and Wordpress (Elementor) plug-ins</b>through this project, as we were trying to create a template that could be edited by high schools <b>without coding.</b></p>

                  <p id="subheader">Initial Browsing</p>
                  <p class="description1">I initially spent some time scouring through the current HUNCH site, trying to understand what HUNCH was all about and how they intended to get their message across through their website. From reading each page, looking at the layout and tabs, and identifying the type of information available on the site, I found there to be a couple <b>key goals</b> for the HUNCH site: <br></br>

                      <b>Key Goals</b><br>
                      01 Empower high school students to get involved regardless of technical level<br>
                      02 Build a larger network of involvement with NASA projects in the public <br>
                      03 Find top talent and be able to connect with them for future work <br>
                      04 Push social media and awareness of NASA HUNCH<br></br>


                  Additionally, there were several <b>problems</b> that came up in my research.<br></br>

                  <b>General Issues</b><br>
                  01 No about page explaining the background/goals of HUNCH<br>
                  02 Schools do not currently have a way to share their process with other schools<br></br>

                  <b>Standardization Issues</b><br>
                  01 Differing sizing on each page and different layouts<br>
                  02 Some pages are extremely fleshed out and others barely have any content<br>
                  03 Issues with spacing and a “pixel perfect” look<br>
                  04 Portraying a common message through the site<br></br>

                  I sought to work on some of these issues through the two pages I was assigned.

                      <p class="description1">I completely revamped the concept behind the social media page. Instead of making a separate 'history' or 'about us' page, I decided to combine that idea with the social media page, coming up with the idea of a “connect” page. The goal of the <b>Connect page</b> would be to allow users to:<br><br>
                      <b>“Connect” with NASA HUNCH’s goal<br>

It was difficult to strike a balance between giving enough information and having too much.</p>

For the second iteration, I I eliminated the tweets and provided two separate formats for if a page has videos or if it doesn’t. I also wanted to come up with a way to focus on specific photos in the archive to reduce the overwhelming nature of the page.</p>

The site is currently being worked on and the changes on Playbook are going to be implemented for the next NEEMO mission. This was my first UX internship and the first time I actually implemented my designs beyond the classroom. Therefore, there was a huge learning curve for me in terms of being able to work directly with software engineers on implementation in an Agile environment.  What I realized is that things often have to be spelled out or extremely pixel perfect and specified for a software engineer to carry out a design exactly as it is meant to be. Outside of improving my design skills, working with JIRA and understanding how to document interactions and specifications were some of the most valuable things I learned during this internship. </p>
