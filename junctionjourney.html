My team was tasked<br>with understanding what the company does and figuring out where there is an opportunity<br>to potentially grow awareness of their business in the local Pittsburgh community.</p>

                <p class="text">My team and I came up with Junction Journey: a mobile application for kids that uses game theory to aid children in learning about sustainability and conservation. Through competing with other schools for sustainability challenges and learning about furniture reuse, Junction Journey would not only be training the next generation, but they would also be penetrating an important target market: schools and educators - simply by their interaction with children on a daily basis.</p>

                <p class="text">We first did some initial research on Construction Junction and how it fits in with the rest of the Pittsburgh community. Through our research, we found that Construction Junction is committed to raising awareness about sustainability and being environmentally friendly, outside of facilitating the reuse of goods. Currently, they have social media channels they use, but they don't get much traffic. Based on asking people in the community about their familiarity with Construction Junction, it seemed that many people did not know what Construction Junction was, unless they had a need for reused goods.<br></br>We then proceeded to build a stakeholder map of all parties giving and receiving. Larger bubbles indicate opportunities and overlaps represent parties that have some connection to each other. We noticed that there were a significant number of large bubbles under education and we had only seen a few postings for educational workshops and site visits on their social media. This was a huge<strong> opportunity to better connect with schools and educators</strong>, especially given the makeup of the Pittsburgh community - over 29 colleges and many more local high schools and lower education schools.</p>

              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p class="text">Our team came up with 20+ problem statements for why Construction Junction is not currently involved with the education sector. We then voted on which statements we were most interesting to solve and which would be the most impactful for increasing awareness of Construction Junctionâ€™s brand. The three we were interested in solving were:<br></br>
                1. Construction Junction doesn't have a virtual presence with the younger population of Pittsburgh.<br>
                2. Construction Junction doesn't have reusabiity drives at local schools<br>
                3. Schools don't understand exactly what Construction Junction can do for them/how they could benefit<br>
                From this, we synthesized them into one single problem statement:<br></br>
                <strong>Construction Junction doesn't have a virtual presence with local students in Pittsburgh to share and engage them in their vision.</strong>

              <p class="text">Based on the research synthesis, we came up with a few key ideas to focus our mobile service:<br></br><strong>Targeting Word of Mouth Marketing</strong><br>Construction Junction already has all the social media platforms and is still getting pretty limited engagement. <strong> Additionally, 28% of consumers say word of  mouth marketing is the most important factor in strengthening or eroding brand affinity.</strong> <br></br><strong>Targeting Middle School Age Children</strong><br>Pittsburgh has a large number of universities, making it a great idea to target college campuses. However, by targeting middle school children,we will also we targetting those involved with students (parents, teachers, coaches, etc.)<br></br><strong>Gamifying the Experience for Children</strong><br>Since we are targeting middle school age children for a topic like conservation/sustainability we need to engage them and continuously do so, which is why we decided to make the mobile application a game.</p>
