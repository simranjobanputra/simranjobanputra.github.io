                <p class="description1">We took a look at Construction Junction’s goals and business model, their mission and products, and how they are involved with the community, since they are a non-profit organization. Upon initial analysis, we found that many community members refer to Construction as <b>the "junkyard".</b></p>

                  <p class="description1">After doing some analysis we realized that the <b>Construction Junction business model has a two-fold purpose:</b> buying and selling reused goods along with promoting reuse and recycling in the Pittsburgh community through facility tours and workshops.</p>
                <p class="description1"> You can see this even by taking a quick look at their website and social media - <b>more than half of the information is dedicated to this mission of reuse.</b></p>

                <p class="description1">From the social media analysis, it was evident that Construction Junction is <b>not successful in promoting their events and goals to help teach the community about reuse.</b> Thus, our team narrowed it down to two main spaces: focusing on environmental groups and education.</p>

                <p class="description1">We chose to focus on the <b>education market</b> for several reasons over environments:<br><b>Reach</b> to a much larger group of people (parents, students at varying levels, teachers, faculty, coaches<br><b>Give back</b> to the community of Pittsburgh with 68+ schools and universities<br><b>Excitement</b> for potential opportunities that could lie ahead</p>

                <p class="description1">After narrowing down on the Education space, our team had to come up with some way to use a mobile service to engage educators and students with conservation education. We brainstormed questions in four categories to identify key opportunities.</p>
                <img src="images/CJ/questions2.png" alt="Image placeholder" class="img-fluid" width="40%"><br></br>
                <p class="description1">We also used <b>Reverse Assumptions</b> to understand what kinds of mobile services would help us answer these questions</p><br>
                <img src="images/CJ/reverseassumptions.png" alt="Image placeholder" class="img-fluid" width="60%"><br></br>
                <p class="description1">The reverse assumptions exercise was helpful in coming up with ideas for our service. Since community is really important to CJ and host a variety of educational opportunities such as site visits, we decided to hone in on schools and particularly the idea of conservation education. We came up with different problem areas within education.</p>

                <p id="subheader">Problem Statement Development</p>
                <p class="description1">Our team came up with 20+ problem statements, voted on our top three, and combined them into one central problem statement.<br></br><b>Top Three:</b><br>We don't have resuability drives in local schools<br>Schools don't understand exactly what we can do for them/how they could benefit<br>We don't have a virtual presence with the younger population of Pittsburgh<br></br><b>Combined Statement:</b><br><b>We don't have a virtual presence with local students in Pittsburgh to share and engage them in our vision</b></p>

                <p id="subheader">Concept Development</p>
                <p class="description1">There were some key questions we had to answer to work with the problem statement:<br></br>01 What <b>age group</b> of students should we target?<br>02 What’s <b>in it for students</b> to get involved with Construction Junction’s mission?<br> 03 How can we <b>improve the way they are giving out information</b> of their reuse mission?<br>We came up with some ideas to further define the considerations and the problem statement.</p>

                <p class="description1">We first did a roundtable brainstorm session. Each person in our group was given one page and 60 seconds to draw potential ideas for the screens. Then we rotated when the timer rang. This helped us get all of our thoughts out on paper, so we could have a meaningful discussion about the direction of our mobile app. We also created plans for how we wanted to setup our app prior to low-fi sketching.</p>

              Our goal is to foster a love for reuse and recycling in our community’s children through competitive games, challenges, and technology experiences. In turn, we hope to college valuable data about our youth, educate them about reuse, and build Construction Junction’s brand value.

                <p class="text">We first did some initial research on Construction Junction and how it fits in with the rest of the Pittsburgh community. Through our research, we found that Construction Junction is committed to raising awareness about sustainability and being environmentally friendly, outside of facilitating the reuse of goods. Currently, they have social media channels they use, but they don't get much traffic. Based on asking people in the community about their familiarity with Construction Junction, it seemed that many people did not know what Construction Junction was, unless they had a need for reused goods.<br></br>We then proceeded to build a stakeholder map of all parties giving and receiving. Larger bubbles indicate opportunities and overlaps represent parties that have some connection to each other. We noticed that there were a significant number of large bubbles under education and we had only seen a few postings for educational workshops and site visits on their social media. This was a huge<strong> opportunity to better connect with schools and educators</strong>, especially given the makeup of the Pittsburgh community - over 29 colleges and many more local high schools and lower education schools.</p>

                <p class="text">Our team came up with 20+ problem statements for why Construction Junction is not currently involved with the education sector. We then voted on which statements we were most interesting to solve and which would be the most impactful for increasing awareness of Construction Junction’s brand. The three we were interested in solving were:<br></br>
                1. Construction Junction doesn't have a virtual presence with the younger population of Pittsburgh.<br>
                2. Construction Junction doesn't have reusabiity drives at local schools<br>
                3. Schools don't understand exactly what Construction Junction can do for them/how they could benefit<br>
                From this, we synthesized them into one single problem statement:<br></br>
                <strong>Construction Junction doesn't have a virtual presence with local students in Pittsburgh to share and engage them in their vision.</strong>

              <p class="text">Based on the research synthesis, we came up with a few key ideas for why a mobile application might be successful:<br></br><strong>Targeting Word of Mouth Marketing</strong><br>Construction Junction already has all the social media platforms and is still getting pretty limited engagement. We need to introduce something that people will talk about, since <strong>28% of consumers say word of mouth marketing is the most important factor in strengthening or eroding brand affinity</strong>.<br></br><strong>Targeting Middle School Age Children</strong><br>Pittsburgh has a large number of universities, making it a great idea to target college campuses. However, by targeting middle school children,we will also we targetting those involved with students (parents, teachers, coaches, etc.)<br></br><strong>Gamifying the Experience for Children</strong><br>Since we are targeting middle school age children for a topic like conservation/sustainability we need to engage them and continuously do so, which is why we decided to make the mobile application a game.</p>
