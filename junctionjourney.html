We need to introduce something that people will talk about, since <strong>28% of consumers say word of mouth marketing is the most important factor in strengthening or eroding brand affinity</strong>.<br></br><strong>Targeting Middle School Age Children</strong><br>Pittsburgh has a large number of universities, making it a great idea to target college campuses. However, by targeting middle school children,we will also we targetting those involved with students (parents, teachers, coaches, etc.)<br></br><strong>Gamifying the Experience for Children</strong><br>Since we are targeting middle school age children for a topic like conservation/sustainability we need to engage them and continuously do so, which is why we decided to make the mobile application a game.</p>
