Currently available navigation techniques (GPS, Bluetooth beacons, etc) are capable of supporting navigation to within 5m of a desired target, however, are <b>not capable of robust navigation and spatial tasks in the 2-3 meter range.</b> We frame this problem as the <b>"last meter problem".</b> Our approach to solving this is by using tactile surfaces or <b>textured ground surfaces</b> that one can sense through touch or by walking on them, perhaps in combination with some bluetooth/audio tool.</p>

                  <p class="description1">Once we had a foundation, we started the 3D Fabrication process of building tiles. For the initial prototype, we wanted to build a generic tile that could be used to sense any kind of pressure. The goal was to 1) have something we could <b>use in future interviews with users to test our hypotheses</b> and 2) <b>integrate with some audio or haptic sensing information to provide feedback</b> to a visually impaired user. The fabrication process had a huge learning curve, particularly with machining and understanding what were the best materials to use.</p>

                  <p class="description1">Creating a mold that we could use for prototyping was the first step. We originally tried to 3D print tiles using a makerbot, but due to the excessive time required, we switched over to a <b>CNC for tile production.</b> These tile molds were used to later mold the plastic and velostat for our initial prototype. </p>

                  <p class="description1"> To mock up the initial tile, we wanted something that could take pressure and that someone could step on. Thus, we used a combination of <b>plastic and velostat - the plastic to withstand someone stepping on it and the velostat to be embedded underneath to sense pressure and eventually be paired with Arduino for data collection.</b> However, the process for finding the right plastic was tough - we starting with Polycarbonates and eventually invested in ABS plastic for the thermoforming. During thermoforming, or molding the plastic into the shape of the tile, the <b>Polycarbonate melted on the corners and had air bubbles under temperatures higher than 375 degrees F.</b> Additionally, we found out that our <b>heat source must be underneath</b> the plastic instead of on top, so that aided us in finding a solution.  We experimented with different materials,  melting points, and different heat sources to find the right combination of materials.

                <p class="description1">The material experimentation happened in sync with multiple vacuum forming attempts. <b>We originally used a traditional vacuum former in hopes that we could find a more low-cost alternative.</b> However, after several attempts we had to move on to a more advanced vacuum forming machine. Since this project is still ongoing, when we produce kits for people, the hope is that we can still find a different low-cost alternative as needed.</p>

                <p class="description1">Once we had a prototype with all the parts, we proceeded to integrate Arduino. The <b>purpose of the Arduino is to be able sense pressure - the potential pressure that would come from stepping on a tile or using a cane to press down on a tile.</b> We wanted to see what sort of data we could collect to better understand what sort of feedback we could give to someone who is visually impaired. We used copper tape to ensure conductivity between the two pieces. The next step is to integrate audio with the pressure sensing. You can see videos of the two separate parts to the right!

                  With a working prototype, we resumed our iterative research process to get opinions from visually impaired users. Our plan was to first send out an <b>initial survey on Twitter</b> and then find users that we surveyed who may be interested in an in-person interview and prototype testing session. Currently we are in the process of getting IRB approval for the survey and hope to get the survey out in early January.

                <p class="description1">We are currently just ending the ideation phase for this project and starting the iteration phase. The next phase is to <b>try out different tile patterns, both those found outdoors and also custom patterns</b> in an attempt to find the right combination of something that's functional and meets the needs of solving the last meter problem. Then, we hope to gather results of the Twitter survey and conduct in person interviews while continuing to build out the technology. The final product would be some sort of <b>toolkit that we could hand-off so people can make interactive tiles within the buildings or outdoor spaces that they need them in.</b> <br></br><br></br>My experience with the accessibility team has been extremely rewarding. I learned about so <b>many prototyping tools and technologies</b> in such a short period of time. I really wanted to grow my ability to be "thrifty" and be able to mock something up quickly and comfortably, which I improved on considerably this semester. The hope in the next semester is that I continue to develop these skills as well as further develop the project with my UX knowledge, especially building a product that we could perhaps bring to market.
